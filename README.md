# 🧠 System Design Notes & Diagrams

This repository contains my personal notes on **system design concepts**,
focusing on **clean architecture, UML diagrams, and real-world system modeling**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build strong system design fundamentals
- Practice translating requirements into designs
- Prepare for backend & full-stack interviews
